##******************ONLY IF YOU HAVE CONVERTED YOUR TABLE TO InnoDB**********************
##**********************WARNING - YOU MAY NOT LIKE THE RESULTS***************************

# run this and update binaries, processes releases and
# every half day get tv/theatre info and optimise the database
# every 2 hours run cleanup scripts

# These scripts are constantly changing (still learning). If something doesn't work as expected /msg jonnyboy on irc.
# Tell me what is broken and I'll check and fix if necessary.

# I have tested this with all of the tables converted to InnoDB, not just parts and binaries.

# These scripts make changes to the default newznab files, svn up'dating you newznab install will require to rerun the
# setup script.
# These scripts will create a tmux session and run several scripts at once. The bottleneck is postprocessing
# the releases is doing all of the lookups for all of the releases, while on after the other. These scripts change that.
# I have removed all of the lookups to thier own script and they run independantly of the other scripts.

# What will actually be running, separately and at the same time:
# nzb-import - imports nzb's backfills and gets current - loops
# processNfos
# processing - all of the othe postprocessing scripts
# processAdditional
# update_releases and the cleanup scripts in a loop

# Setup: do not set your retention days to 0, the import

set -e
