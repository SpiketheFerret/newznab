# OLD SCRIPTS - USE CURRENT

## Newznab all in one Scripts - Threaded

There are 2 sets of scripts. If, you have or want InnoDB tables, then you should use the scripts in the innodb folder. Otherwise, use the scripts in the myisam folder.

The scripts in the old folder are kept for my reference.

The scripts in the myisam folder were created by request, I do not know if the will bloat your database. Let me know your results.
